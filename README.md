# Map-Machine-learning
A machine learning/Algorithms project

This projects uses the Dijkstra's and A* algorithms to find the shortest path using a data set for a graph
using the duration between two places and the weight for the edges.

" Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between a given node (which is called the "source node") and all other nodes in a graph. This algorithm uses the weights of the edges to find the path that minimizes the total distance (weight) between the source node and all other nodes."

# Map-Machine-learning
A machine learning/Algorithms project

This projects uses the Dijkstra's and A* algorithms to find the shortest path using a data set for a graph
using the duration between two places and the weight for the edges.

" Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between a given node (which is called the "source node") and all other nodes in a graph. This algorithm uses the weights of the edges to find the path that minimizes the total distance (weight) between the source node and all other nodes." Estefania Cassingena Navone (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-visual-introduction/#:~:text=Dijkstra's%20Algorithm%20finds%20the%20shortest,node%20and%20all%20other%20nodes.) and the " A* (pronounced as "A star") is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. The algorithm efficiently plots a walkable path between multiple nodes, or points, on the graph." Thaddeus Abiy et al (https://brilliant.org/wiki/a-star-search/#:~:text=A*%20(pronounced%20as%20%22A,or%20points%2C%20on%20the%20graph.&text=On%20a%20map%20with%20many,to%20B%20can%20be%20difficult. ). This is why these two algorithms are the best to solve this particular task.
